                <p>
                  By accessing and using Universal Loan's services, you agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions.

                <p>
                  All loan applications are subject to approval. We reserve the right to decline any application 
                  without providing specific reasons. Application approval depends on creditworthiness assessment, 
                  income verification, and other factors as determined by Universal Loan.

                <p>
                  Interest rates are determined based on loan type, amount, term, and applicant's credit profile. 
                  All rates and fees will be clearly disclosed before loan approval. Additional fees may apply for 
                  late payments, returned payments, or other specified circumstances.

                <p>
                  Borrowers agree to repay loans according to the schedule outlined in the loan agreement. 
                  Early repayment is permitted and may result in interest savings. Late payments may incur 
                  additional fees and impact credit reporting.

                <h2 className="text-2xl font-mono font-bold text-foreground mb-4">5. Use of Information</h2>
                <p>
                  By applying for a loan, you authorize Universal Loan to obtain and verify information from 
                  credit bureaus, banks, employers, and other relevant sources. This information is used 
                  solely for loan assessment and servicing purposes.

                <p>
                  Failure to make payments as agreed constitutes default. In case of default, Universal Loan 
                  may report to credit bureaus, engage collection agencies, or pursue legal action to recover
                  outstanding amounts.
